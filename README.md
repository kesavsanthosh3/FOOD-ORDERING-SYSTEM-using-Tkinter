Food Ordering System using Tkinter-Python and other python libraries

### Abstract
Before the Covid crisis, everything in the working areas was manual. Everything is online right now. So, we are attempting to make food management available online through this initiative. Through this project ” Online food ordering system ” we are providing a platform for users to order food online with less time and efforts. The platform uses computers to channelize, record, store, and modify the transaction. That is even simpler than placing a takeout order at a restaurant or motel. Today's computers are dependable and there is no danger of duplication, so working will go more smoothly.Compared to the book approach, there is less turmoil and confusion while utilising the online system.

### Introduction
A straightforward and practical method for clients to order meals online without having to physically visit the restaurant is the online food ordering system. The internet is what makes this arrangement possible; it is the medium that links the client and the restaurant or food provider.
According to this concept, a consumer would visit the restaurant's app or website, browse through the many food items, combinations, and cuisines offered, and then proceed to choose and buy the stuff they require. A delivery worker will then bring these things to the customer's doorstep at the time of their choosing.
